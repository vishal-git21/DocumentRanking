# Aggregating Scores from Multiple Ranking Factors for Document Ranking

## Project Overview
The project "Aggregating Scores from Multiple Ranking Factors for Document Ranking" addresses the critical task of enhancing document ranking within information retrieval systems. By leveraging multiple ranking factors, the project aims to improve the efficiency of delivering relevant content to users based on their queries.

## Key Features
- **Multifaceted Approach:** Considers various factors influencing document relevance, including TF-IDF scores, document length, keyword frequency, author credibility, and publishing date.
- **Python and Libraries:** Utilizes Python programming language along with essential libraries such as NLTK and scikit-learn for text preprocessing, metadata extraction, and score computation.
- **Score Calculation:** Computes individual scores for each document based on the identified ranking factors.
- **Weighted Aggregation:** Aggregates scores using weighted techniques to generate a final ranking of documents tailored to user queries.

## Project Workflow
1. **Text Preprocessing:** Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.
2. **Metadata Extraction:** Extracts metadata such as document length, author information, and publishing date using appropriate techniques.
3. **Score Computation:** Calculates scores for each document based on TF-IDF, keyword frequency, author credibility, and other defined factors.
4. **Aggregation:** Applies weighted aggregation methods to combine individual scores into a final ranking score for each document.
5. **Output:** Generates a ranked list of documents that best match user queries, enhancing the efficiency of information retrieval processes.

## Usage
- **Setup:** Ensure Python and required libraries (NLTK, scikit-learn) are installed.
- **Execution:** Run the main script or application file to initiate document ranking based on provided queries.
- **Output:** Review the generated ranked list of documents to assess the effectiveness of the ranking approach.
